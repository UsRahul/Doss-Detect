# DDoS Detector and Attacker using Kali Linux and Metasploitable

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting and simulating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using **Kali Linux** for attack simulation and **Metasploitable** as the target system. The goal is to analyze network traffic, identify DDoS patterns, and develop a machine learning-based detection mechanism.

## Features

- **DDoS Attack Simulation**: Uses Kali Linux tools to generate DDoS attacks.
- **Detection Mechanism**: Implements machine learning models to identify and mitigate attacks.
- **Traffic Analysis**: Monitors network packets to detect anomalies.
- **Logging & Reporting**: Stores attack logs for further analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Kali Linux** (for attack simulation)
- **Metasploitable** (as a vulnerable target machine)
- **Wireshark/Tshark** (for packet analysis)
- **Scapy** (for custom packet generation and analysis)
- **Python** (for machine learning-based detection)
- **scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy** (for ML models)
